## Ingredients
- 4 pounds tri-tip roast

- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced

- ⅓ cup salt

- ⅓ cup black pepper

- ⅓ cup garlic salt or to taste
## Directions
**Step 1**<br/> 
Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the roast; insert garlic slices into the slits.<br/> 

**Step 2**<br/>
Mix salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl; rub all over the tri-tip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before grilling.<br/>

**Step 3**<br/>
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.<br/> 

**Step 4**<br/> 
Place the meat directly above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the juices, about 5 to 10 minutes per side.<br/> 

**Step 5**<br/> 
Turn the grill down to medium heat and continue to cook, turning occasionally, for another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 5 minutes before slicing.<br/>
